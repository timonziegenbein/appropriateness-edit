i think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe: - in the united states women are paid only 75{\textcent} for every \$1.00 a man is paid for the identical work. - 70{\textbackslash}\% of the 1.3 billion people in the world loving in poverty are women. - two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. - 75{\textbackslash}\% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women. - women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10{\textbackslash}\% of the world's income and own less than 1{\textbackslash}\% of the world's property. tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? how can anyone NOT be a feminist?\end{abstract}
