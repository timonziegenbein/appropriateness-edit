You lost me--- 99{\textbackslash}\% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism --- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)\end{abstract}
