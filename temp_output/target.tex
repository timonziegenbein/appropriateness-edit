You lost me--- 99{\textbackslash}\% of what you say speaks in favor of evolution and against creationism. While science may not have all the answers, there is evidence to suggest that evolution occurred over a long period of time, which contradicts the creationism viewpoint. While this might be accepted by some, many liberal theologians and agnostics would be open to the idea that evolution and creationism can coexist.   This can be seen as a compromise between the two beliefs, allowing for a balance between the two. While this view may not be accepted by everyone, it provides an alternative perspective which accommodates both theories.
