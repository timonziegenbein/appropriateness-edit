In my opinion, the Conservative Party is largely driven by individuals who prioritize their own financial gains and benefits, at the expense of wider society. This is evidenced by the policies implemented by ministers such as Michael Gove, who was seen as detrimental to education. The new minister of Women and Equality has also voted against gay marriage, suggesting a possible inconsistency between her stated values and her policies. While this shift may bring some change, it is likely that it will be a gradual and incremental process, rather than a radical transformation.
