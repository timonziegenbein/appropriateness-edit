I think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe:   - in the United States, women are paid only 75{\textcent} for every \$1.00 a man is paid for the identical work.  - 70{\textbackslash}\% of the 1.3 billion people in the world living in poverty are women. - Two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls.  - 75{\textbackslash}\% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women. - Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet own only 10{\textbackslash}\% of the world's income.   Tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? How can anyone NOT be a feminist?
