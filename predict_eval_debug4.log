Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. Sentence 2: And I know many children get adopted but many don't and it might be better off to just have an abortion to let them suffer. Sentence 3: That's the chance they take, I guess. Sentence 4: But who are we to decide one womans pregnancy. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Explanation:

* For Sentence 1, the original sentence is phrased as a question, which is not a strong statement of opinion. The rewritten sentence is a more direct statement of the idea, making it clear that the speaker believes we should not judge what is right or wrong.
* For Sentence 2, the original sentence is phrased as a question, which is not a strong statement of opinion. The rewritten sentence is a more direct statement of the idea, making it clear that the speaker believes we should allow people to make decisions and live with the consequences.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: i think abortion is an acceptable choice, and i think it's ridiculous that it's looked down upon. Input Sentences: Sentence 1: All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. Sentence 2: But I slowly realized, it's not really a fully formed human, how could it be murder? Sentence 3: This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Sentence 4: Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. Sentence 5: Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm interested to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my view. Sentence 6: If it matters, I'm Christian, 16, and male.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv i believe human civilization is doomed. *please* change my view. Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Well, I hate to be a downer, guys, but I don't think humanity has another 100 years left (give or take a few years). Sentence 2: I want to believe that things will be alright, but when you keep hearing worse and worse news about the environmental degradation of the planet (even if you are still somehow a climate-change denier, you have to admit the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this ok. Sentence 3: I hate to say it, but I don't think we have another century left. Sentence 4: Please tell me why I'm wrong. Sentence 5: Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not talking about human extinction. Sentence 6: We'll probably survive whatever happens to some degree. Sentence 7: I mean I think that society will likely collapse. Sentence 8: Humans may still be around, but in a Mad Max/The Road/Book of Eli type of existence. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I have a strong opinion that before having children, the prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests. Sentence 2: Kids being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with. Sentence 3: You may have that limited case where the parents are morons and the kids strive to be different then their failure parents, but in most cases it is an endless line of parasites on our world. Sentence 4: We need more smart people. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Sorry, one more thing: I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion.... Sentence 2: Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against. Sentence 3: If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. Sentence 4: This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: A women and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Sentence 2: Why is that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Sentence 3: Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty?

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Should the drinking age be lowered to 18????? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: You know I really don't see why not? Sentence 2: After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. Sentence 3: I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US are too freaking retarded and dont' know how to act right. Sentence 4: Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or anyother problems? Sentence 5: Think about that!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Can the police keep your car permantly if you have 3rd suspended license? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time? Sentence 2: Man, you're just not getting the message, are you? Sentence 3: If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm. Sentence 4: Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef. Sentence 5: Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive. Sentence 6: People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan. Sentence 7: Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6...and a link to it below. Sentence 8: It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. Sentence 9: You really need to stop driving. Sentence 10: Really. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Why did california ban 50 bmg rifles when these rifles have never been used in violent crime in ca? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. Sentence 2: Your part right on it never being used in a violent crime. Sentence 3: I'm not sure where it happened but so far only one person in the united states has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon Sentence 4: and i believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. Sentence 5: The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal. Sentence 6: When california passed the law Barrett actually ended the warrenties on the LAPD M99's, and then came out with the CA legal .416 rifle. Sentence 7: Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so CA made an exception for .50cal blackpowder rifles!(which are easier to get by criminals) JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv penalty shoot outs do not allow the better team to win, only the luckier team. they should not be used in knockout round matches in soccer. Input Sentences: Sentence 1: It's a lottery - luck of the draw. Sentence 2: It will decide a winner, to be sure. Sentence 3: But the better team doesn't always win. Sentence 4: And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup. Sentence 5: The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either. Sentence 6: Why not? Sentence 7: How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT? Sentence 8: There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play. Sentence 9: It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important. Sentence 10: CMV JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: If your spouse committed murder and he or she confided in you would you turn them in Input Sentences: Sentence 1: More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. Sentence 2: But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Christianity or atheism Input Sentences: Sentence 1: As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Sentence 2: Christianity however is not it. Sentence 3: Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. Sentence 4: I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Sentence 5: Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. Sentence 6: With Atheïsm, the concept is pretty clear. Sentence 7: It is more scientific, and I like that. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Why is it ok for the media to invade people's privacy, but not ok the government or private citizens do? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. Sentence 2: It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications. Sentence 3: However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money. Sentence 4: Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Sentence 5: Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock. Sentence 6: The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: The word for this debate is [sacrifice] How much would a person really "sacrifice" for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? Sentence 3: No matter where a person is in thier life.... Sentence 4: Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

2025-10-23 15:25:38,327 | INFO | __main__ | Model completion: Here's the JSON output for the given sentences:

```
{
  "sentence_edits": [
    {
      "sentence_id": 1,
      "rewritten_sentence": "TV is often preferred over books because it allows for immersive exploration of the world from the comfort of your own home.",
      "edits": [

          "reason": "Missing Intelligibility"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the given sentence, "better" is a vague term and could be improved for clarity. The original sentence also lacks precision in explaining why TV is preferred over books. The rewritten sentence aims to provide a more specific and clear reason for the preference.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Sex offenders register for the united kingdom? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: If you are with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. Sentence 2: It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. Sentence 3: If you will look at the horrendous crimes against children, they are children that were not being supervised by a parent. Sentence 4: Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Sentence 5: Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: it is just as wrong to discriminate based on income, as it is on sex/race/religion/orientation/etc Input Sentences: Sentence 1: People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich (especially on reddit). Sentence 2: I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination. Sentence 3: America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?! Sentence 4: Additional taxes and discrimination on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv believing in 'sin' is the reason rape is high in the middle east and asia. Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Being horny is a sin. Sentence 2: Wanking is a sin Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin Raping is a sin If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. Sentence 3: We should teach morals not religion. Sentence 4: Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. Sentence 5: You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong Sentence 6: so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? Sentence 7: I'm not say rape is right just that consential sex with a girlfirend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing rape.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: she is gonna move to texas to a place where she will be in the minority. Sentence 3: 13% of the entire town is white. Sentence 4: mostly gang territory.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: If your spouse committed murder and he or she confided in you would you turn them in Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad Sentence 2: but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Sentence 3: Hmmm that is a hard one. Sentence 4: Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. Sentence 5: But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Is it better to have a lousy father or to be fatherless Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Sentence 2: Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Sentence 3: Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. Sentence 4: so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: The last thing they need is someone who lives with you and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

        }
      ]
    }

}
```

Explanation: The original sentence uses the word "putting together", which is a phrase that is less common in formal writing. The rewritten sentence uses the more common phrase "assembling", which conveys the same meaning.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Would you be willing to vote for a national id card system? if not, why not? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card. Sentence 2: Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number. Sentence 3: Our government has just made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time. Sentence 4: When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation. Sentence 5: You can use a passport, or state issued id & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc. Sentence 6: There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers. Sentence 7: The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have. Sentence 8: Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundent worthless laws. Sentence 9: And we keep re-electing them. Sentence 10: So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' monies. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Massachusetts melanie's law? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Sentence 2: Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. Sentence 3: I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. Sentence 4: I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. Sentence 5: That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. Sentence 6: People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Sentence 7: Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. Sentence 8: And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Sentence 9: Good luck.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Should news outlets first get government approval before reporting stories? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: If 1/2 the schools in the US thinks yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Sentence 2: Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. Sentence 3: I thought schools get taught the Constitution and bill of rights. Sentence 4: At least I would expect thee civil war to be mentioned before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Sentence 5: Freedom of speech, FREEDOM OF PRESS, freedom of religion, and so on. Sentence 6: With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not new great Brittan or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. Sentence 7: ( ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. Sentence 8: No wonder why 1/2 the youth is lost and confused) JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story. Sentence 2: Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. Sentence 3: They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Sentence 4: Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. Sentence 5: This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Sentence 6: Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Explanation of the corrections:

Sentence 1:
- The original sentence has an unnecessary quotation mark around " being too close to the local population ". The rewritten sentence removes this quotation mark.

Sentence 2:
- The original sentence uses "that it is unfair", which is a more formal and less common way of expressing the thought. The rewritten sentence uses "it's unfair", which is a more informal and commonly used way of expressing the thought.
- The original sentence says "be unjustly sent off like that", which is unclear. The rewritten sentence uses "was unjustly treated in this way", which is a more clear and concise way of expressing the thought.

In this output, I've made the following changes:

1. The original sentence starts with "i LIKE porn", which is an informal and emotional expression. I've rewritten it to "Some people enjoy watching porn" to make it more neutral and objective.
2. The phrase "jerking off" is a colloquialism that may be considered impolite or off-putting in some contexts. I've rewritten it to "watching it" to make it more neutral and respectful.
3. The phrase "is always a good time" is a subjective and potentially misleading statement. I've rewritten it to "can be a form of relaxation" to make it more neutral and accurate.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Do you think oil companies run the world governments ? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Oil does rule all politics unfortunately. Sentence 2: But can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Sentence 3: Use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Sentence 4: Use this energy to split water into its prime components. Sentence 5: Let oxygen into the air. Sentence 6: Burn the Hydrogen in our cars and have water as the resulting by product. Sentence 7: You could almost make this work in your back garden! Sentence 8: We would only need lubricating oils then which could probably be created from vegetable sources! JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: i believe that most psychedelic drugs should be legal Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Sentence 2: Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. Sentence 3: As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Sentence 4: Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. Sentence 5: I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal. Sentence 6: Obviously when I say "psychedelics" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive. Sentence 7: Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other ones that may be harmful should not be legalized. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Sentence 3: Scientists could be foucusing on our world problems frist and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. Sentence 4: What if we focus on that and near the eand we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientist caring to much about other things when there lives also could be in stake JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Is the school uniform a good or bad idea Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Bad. Sentence 2: I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. Sentence 3: I had to wear one for 4 years at school. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: i do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Should physical education be mandatory in schools Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. Sentence 2: There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. Sentence 3: There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Sentence 4: Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Gay marriage right or wrong Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Do gay marriages hurt anyone? Sentence 2: No. Sentence 3: Do gay marriages kill many people? Sentence 4: No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? Sentence 5: No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? Sentence 6: No. Sentence 7: Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? Sentence 8: If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Sentence 9: Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. Sentence 10: God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Sentence 11: Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Sentence 12: Enough said. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Why does the us have the highest drinking age in the world? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Because we are not taught from a young age to respect alchohol. Sentence 2: If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. Sentence 3: Thats why so many teenagers have to drink till they get sick and act like twits. Sentence 4: Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. Sentence 5: You aint sexy when you get drunk. Sentence 6: Backwards is alcohol thinking in America. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: i feel that surrogacy is wrong Input Sentences: Sentence 1: _____ Sentence 2: I know that with science most people are now able to have children Sentence 3: but i fell its just selfish. Sentence 4: There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend what is over $3000 just to get a surrogate doesn't sit right with me. Sentence 5: Also the most successful suorrgate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Sentence 6: Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Business review: 2.0 stars business name: woody's burger bar and grill. city: etobicoke. categories: burgers, bars, restaurants, nightlife Input Sentences: Sentence 1: If you have lots of time to spare waiting for an ok burger, then this place is for you! Sentence 2: 25 minutes to get serve a burger is just way too long. Sentence 3: I have wasted my time, money and yes, precious calories on this place! Sentence 4: I wish that I would have gone to McDonalds and either have the same experience, if not better. Sentence 5: Now, I'm just enjoying a fresh bowl of salad. Sentence 6: Thanks to the extra calories that I sacrificed for nothing. Sentence 7: Boo!!! Sentence 8: It's amazing how this place is still getting a very high rating.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! Sentence 3: Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. Sentence 4: The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. Sentence 5: It's pointlessss. Sentence 6: :/ Sentence 7: OH AND. Sentence 8: Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Sentence 9: Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: How do you punish islamic extremist terrorists for whom mere death creates martyrdom? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I say, sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Sentence 2: Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terroist. Sentence 3: I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. Sentence 4: Might not deter anyone, but what will? JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: If you never punished your puppy for accidents in the house...? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Ya know, public corporal punishment used to be executed in this country, the crime level was lower but there were also a lot less people living in the country. Sentence 2: I am not sure that is a good idea, but something has to be done, the crime rate is out of control. Sentence 3: What's sad I think is that corporal punishment might work, but it would be a media circus and then in turn be useless, there has to be a better answer!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted. Sentence 2: Needless to say they should have let her. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>


2025-10-23 15:38:13,379 | INFO | __main__ | Model completion: Here's the analysis and edit of the given sentences:

```json
{
  "sentence_edits": [
    {
      "sentence_id": 1,
      "rewritten_sentence": "Adolf Hitler's mother considered an abortion, but it was not performed.",
      "edits": [
        {
          "inappropriate_part": "Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted",
          "rewritten_part": "Adolf Hitler's mother considered an abortion, but it was not performed",
          "reason": "Toxic Emotions"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "sentence_id": 2,
      "rewritten_sentence": "It would have been better to allow her that option.",
      "edits": [
        {
          "inappropriate_part": "Needless to say they should have let her",
          "rewritten_part": "It would have been better to allow her that option",
          "reason": "Missing Intelligibility"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Here's the explanation for each edit:

1. Sentence 1: The original sentence is edited to remove the emotive language and provide a more neutral description of the event. This is done to reduce the intensity of the emotion and make the statement more suitable for a neutral discussion.
2. Sentence 2: The original sentence is edited to make the reasoning clearer and more understandable. The rewritten sentence conveys the same idea but in a more logical and less emotive way.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: having some choices are good. Sentence 2: but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. Sentence 3: i have always been pro life. Sentence 4: and yes i do believe abortions should be illegal. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Note: The reason for "if you were in charge of all the choices in your life" is "Other Reasons" because it seems like the sentence is grammatically correct, but it might be a bit confusing as it implies a hypothetical scenario, but the sentence structure is not incorrect.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: What would happen? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Is this a traffic ticket? Sentence 2: What does it say on the ticket? Sentence 3: If it says that there is a mandatory court appearance, then you need to go. Sentence 4: I wouldn't listen to the cop. Sentence 5: Unless it's printed on the ticket that you need to appear, just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. Sentence 6: It is important that you follow the printed instructions period. Sentence 7: Or just ask your husband. Sentence 8: He probably knows the city's counsel and can get you out of this whole thing. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Do you think prostitution should be legalized? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws. Sentence 2: Same thing with drugs - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. Sentence 3: There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Is it ethical to use offensive language on this site? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Even if there arent any minors, the language which you use , should atrract the people and not distract. Sentence 2: There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep ' I dont care ' kind of the attitude. Sentence 3: They think that you cant catch them. Sentence 4: They dont even care to see your reaction. Sentence 5: They dont wait for one. Sentence 6: They know well that thier answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care ? Sentence 7: Just vomit and earn few points. Sentence 8: Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they dont have. Sentence 9: Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in thier approach. Sentence 10: Come on....'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term. Sentence 11: The ethics, values etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. Sentence 12: You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language. Sentence 13: Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us. Sentence 14: Hope to hear from you soon.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: the expectation for men to put the toilet seat down after urinating is an unreasonable request. Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way). Sentence 2: The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. Sentence 3: And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. Sentence 4: And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. Sentence 5: Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics. Sentence 2: Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. Sentence 3: This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly). Sentence 4: It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution. Sentence 5: To really properly analize these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point). Sentence 6: The statistics for african-americans is even worse - something like 6000+ african-american inmates per 100,000. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Every country that has had gun control used the law to murder it's citizen,how does it make you feel? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners. Sentence 2: Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?" Sentence 3: Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?" Sentence 4: See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: i belive that every college campus should be forced to allow concealed carry. Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Sentence 2: Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Sentence 3: Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Sentence 4: Once I managed to drove off. Sentence 5: The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. Sentence 6: This has led me to advocate for campus carry. Sentence 7: I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. Sentence 8: The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses. Sentence 9: Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Cmv: cmv: i think feminist activists are more devoted to fighting the sexism of the poor and working classes (street harassment, how much space men take up in the subway), and only pay lip service to fighting the sexism of the well off (lack of female ceo's and politicians, wage disparity). Input Sentences: Sentence 1: As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. Sentence 2: Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the work I think supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no-brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. Sentence 3: The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. Sentence 4: The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. Sentence 5: So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Sentence 6: Why do street harassment and terms of address merit more attention than institutional discrimination? JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Is "islamophobia" justifiable? stance: yes, it i justified Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures. Sentence 2: For instance: "But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....." Sentence 3: Surah 9:5 or: “O ye who believe! Sentence 4: Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123) Sentence 5: And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war. Sentence 6: Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism. Sentence 7: Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website. Sentence 3: What he says goes. Sentence 4: If he wants to post rules condemning or dignifying anything, I will follow them. Sentence 5: But he hasn't. Sentence 6: He has left us as a community to make our own decisions. Sentence 7: I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. Sentence 8: If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it. Sentence 9: I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. Sentence 10: It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve. Sentence 11: I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Oh my, you are either very young or new to this country. Sentence 2: If you have money or you are famous, you can buy whatever judgement or law that you want enacted. Sentence 3: If you are poor then you are just out of luck. Sentence 4: Lawyers will not take your case unless it means very big money for them. Sentence 5: Even if you are totally in the right unless they can make a huge profit they will not touch it. Sentence 6: So, repeat after me. Sentence 7: Money equals privilage under the law.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Reality tv stance: garbage Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Reality Tv is garbage... Sentence 2: First of all it is scripted... Sentence 3: just meant for amusment and it is not really reality. Sentence 4: People live vicarously through reality tv shows. Sentence 5: Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner, for example the bachelor, teachers our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Sentence 6: Also, many of the reality shows, such as rock of love, flavor flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Battleground: bad company 2 vs call of duty stance: bad company!!! Input Sentences: Sentence 1: bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason also the maps are waaaaaaay to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus weapons on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: Be it TV or books. Sentence 3: By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. Sentence 4: "What if they would go left? Sentence 5: They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Sentence 6: Even viewing tv requires brains. Sentence 7: And moreover we can watch television in the dark. Sentence 8: But to read a book you need the lights on. Sentence 9: Which also wastes electricity. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Tv is better than books Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Yes I would say it has you relax in case your tired, but you can read to relax as well. Sentence 2: Plus have you ever considered about the commercials and how annoying they are? JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: How is it possible to buy prescription medicine online without a prescription? its illegal right? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Yes it is illegal in the USA. Sentence 2: However, it can be done. Sentence 3: The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medications (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc. Sentence 4: I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable. Sentence 5: But for other drugs I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds). Sentence 6: If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale. Sentence 7: Good luck, but remember it's illegal and potentially dangerous to your health. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Although technically, the previous answers are right ( you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and don't pay him! Sentence 2: He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook you won't be seeing the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) Sentence 3: You're moving out at the end of December anyway Sentence 4: and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. Sentence 5: The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc) Sentence 6: So, I say sod him!! Sentence 7: Good luck x JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: !?would so called pro lifers get an abortion?! a question for liberals? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Of course they would if they got in a position where they didn't want a child. Sentence 2: When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like to the other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion". Sentence 3: It's usually okay for them, but their anti-abortion when it's someone else. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Early mesopotamian gods vs all later religions. stance: why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people fr Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Sentence 2: Wouldn't the Christian God, being a jealous god, have made himself known earlier than he did? Sentence 3: If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping "false gods". Sentence 4: Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? Sentence 5: How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Sentence 6: Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Sentence 7: Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols? JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Are humans above the title of animal? stance: no... Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. Sentence 2: Therefore humans are animals. Sentence 3: And how can a human be "above" an animal? Sentence 4: What qualifies as above? Sentence 5: Should there be some sort of intelligence limit that divides humans from being classified as animals? Sentence 6: How does greater intelligence lift humans out of the animal category? Sentence 7: Would an extremely bright dolphin no longer count as an animal? Sentence 8: I must admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal world, but I don't see how this elevates us in any way.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Is the school uniform a good or bad idea Input Sentences: Sentence 1: yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Sentence 2: Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: Fair enough? Sentence 3: If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. Sentence 4: In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Sentence 5: Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. Sentence 6: You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.

Note: I corrected the last edit in the 6th sentence to "Toxic Emotions" as the reason, as the statement is still emotionally charged and appeals to a strong emotion (anger/disapproval) to make a point, which is a characteristic of toxic emotions.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Do you feel that the policies and and laws that have been enacted for child abuse have served their purpose? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Yes. Sentence 2: And they need to be pared down now. Sentence 3: The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. Sentence 4: They do the children more damage than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Sentence 5: Babies included. Sentence 6: I have seen many families destroyed. Sentence 7: My son's is one of them. Sentence 8: And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time. Sentence 9: Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitiation rights with the kids. Sentence 10: This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. Sentence 2: What about the babies choice? Sentence 3: No baby would decide...I"I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I COULD live outside my mothers body) be stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Sentence 2: I think people only ever turn to FAQ pages if rhey can't find what they want within the main site. Sentence 3: When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant. Sentence 4: If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content. Sentence 5: Websites should Never include an FAQ section and I cant find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO. Sentence 6: Change my view.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: * Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past 2 weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation. Sentence 2: * Sentence 3: Hamas declining/ignoring these opportunities of peace have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. Sentence 4: With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel; Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens. Sentence 5: * Sentence 6: Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings. Sentence 7: * Sentence 8: I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!

Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. Sentence 2: It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). Sentence 3: If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Sentence 4: Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. Sentence 5: I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off. Sentence 6: Change my view. JSON Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Immigrayion stance: the u.s. needs more strict, forceful immigration policies Input Sentences: Sentence 1: American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Sentence 2: Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. Sentence 3: On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their childrens public education and ER visits. Sentence 4: They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Sentence 5: Their very status should say it all --illegal-- Sentence 6: We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship "those who are born here = automatic citizens."

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Business review: 4.0 stars business name: dd peckers. city: charlotte. categories: restaurants, pubs, bars, cheesesteaks, nightlife, chicken wings, burgers Input Sentences: Sentence 1: So, this place is a dumpy neighborhood bar located in a not-so great strip mall basically in an alley. Sentence 2: For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. Sentence 3: The food is actually really good. Sentence 4: The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. Sentence 5: They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Sentence 6: Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Sentence 7: Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's "regular" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) Sentence 8: so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together. Sentence 9: So, it is a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Sentence 10: Service is okay at best.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Gay marriage right or wrong Input Sentences: Sentence 1: I am a christian. Sentence 2: The bible says plain out that homosexuality is wrong. Sentence 3: Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the bible is the TRUTH, the WHOLE truth, and the ONLY truth.

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!! Sentence 2: if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm ... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? Sentence 3: if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!! JSON Output: { "sentence_edits": [ { "sentence_id": 1, "rewritten_sentence": "For those discussing rape, consider this:", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "for everyone who is talking about", "rewritten_part": "For those discussing", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "RAPE", "rewritten_part": "rape", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": ", let me ask you one thing!!!!", "rewritten_part": ", consider this:", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 2, "rewritten_sentence": "If you got into a fight and broke your arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of that experience?", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if", "rewritten_part": "If", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "got in", "rewritten_part": "got into", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "a huge fight with someone", "rewritten_part": "a fight", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" }, { "inappropriate_part": "ended up breaking your hand or arm", "rewritten_part": "broke your arm", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "...", "rewritten_part": ",", "reason": "Other Reasons" }, { "inappropriate_part": "cut it off just because it would REMIND you", "rewritten_part": "amputate it just because it would remind you", "reason": "Missing Intelligibility" }, { "inappropriate_part": "expirience???", "rewritten_part": "experience?", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] }, { "sentence_id": 3, "rewritten_sentence": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "edits": [ { "inappropriate_part": "if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!", "rewritten_part": "Most would agree that the logical response is to treat the injury, even if the memory of the event remains.", "reason": "Toxic Emotions" } ] } ] } Now complete the task for the following: Issue: Should freedom of speech be of unlimited proportions regarding religious statements? Input Sentences: Sentence 1: Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Sentence 2: Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. Sentence 3: However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Sentence 4: Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Sentence 5: Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. Sentence 6: However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. Sentence 7: They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Sentence 8: Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? Sentence 9: How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?

Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point. The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order: "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence. "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence. "edits": A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single correction and contains three keys: "inappropriate_part", "rewritten_part", and "reason". The "reason" must be one of the allowed reason values. Definitions for inappropriateness reasons: Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation. Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to others' arguments. Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable. Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above. Allowed Reason values: Toxic Emotions Missing Commitment Missing Intelligibility Other Reasons Example: Issue: Pro choice vs pro life Input Sentences: Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!
