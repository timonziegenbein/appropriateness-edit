def create_llm_prompt(issue: str, sentences: str) -> str:
    """
    Formats the prompt for the LLM based on the provided issue and sentences.

    Args:
        issue: A string describing the topic of the argument.
        sentences: A string containing the sentences of the argument to be analyzed,
                   typically separated by newlines.

    Returns:
        A formatted string ready to be sent to the LLM.

    prompt = f"""Task: Analyze the following argument by breaking it down into individual sentences. For each sentence, identify all inappropriate parts and edit it to make it appropriate while preserving the author's core point.

The output must be a single JSON object with a single key "sentence_edits". The value of this key should be a list of objects. Each object in the list must correspond to a sentence from the original argument and contain three keys in this specific order:
    "sentence_id": The sentence number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the input sentence.
    "rewritten_sentence": The full, clean, and fluent version of the rewritten sentence.
    "tracked_changes": A single string with your edits applied inline for that sentence. Use <del reason="Reason Value"> tags to wrap text you are removing and <ins> tags to wrap the text you are adding. The reason attribute in the <del> tag must be one of the allowed reason values.

Definitions for inappropriateness reasons:
    Toxic Emotions: Emotions appealed to are deceptive or so intense that they discourage critical evaluation.
    Missing Commitment: The issue is not taken seriously or there is no openness to othersâ€™ arguments.
    Missing Intelligibility: Meaning is unclear/irrelevant or reasoning is not understandable.
    Other Reasons: Severe orthographic errors or other issues not covered above.

Allowed Reason values:
    Toxic Emotions
    Missing Commitment
    Missing Intelligibility
    Other Reasons

Example:
    Issue: Pro choice vs pro life
    Input Sentences:
        Sentence 1: for everyone who is talking about RAPE, let me ask you one thing!!!!
