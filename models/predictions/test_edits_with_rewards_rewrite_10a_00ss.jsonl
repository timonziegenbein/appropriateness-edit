While it is true that there are various options available now that were not available at that time, it is still important to consider the value and convenience of the services available. In my opinion, the availability of pizza delivery services until late at night, as well as the variety of options available, makes it a preferred option for many.", "valid": true, "reason_correct": false, "rewards": {"semantic_similarity": 1.0, "fluency": 0.0, "human_like": 1.0, "app": 1.0, "perfect": 0.0}, "original_sentence": "", "sentence_id": 0}]}
