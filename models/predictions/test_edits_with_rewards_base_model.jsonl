{"issue": "Do lesbians have it easier than gay men??   stance: lesbians are more socially accepted by straight people:", "argument": "In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more \"socially acceptable,\" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is \"lowering himself\" to a women's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

{"issue": "Cmv:there are no rational arguments as to why undocumented people in the us should be given amnesty:", "argument": "Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a replies as to why they hold no argument. \"Deportation breaks up families\" Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft. \"Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.\" This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. \" Texas was Mexico's\" This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.
